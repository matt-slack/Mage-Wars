    OCTGN Apprentice Mode

  <div class="content">
    <p> In OCTGN Apprentice Mode we have combined the best features of Apprentice Game and Regular Game modes. This way you get the speed of the Apprentice mode but a good feel for the game, with full mages abilities you also gain the flavor the mage you
      are playing.
    </p>
    <p> The spellbooks are tuned for each mages strengths and we have provided spellbooks for all 12 Mages.</p>
    <p> Play is with all of the Mages normal attributes as documented on the Mage's Ability card. The only thing that is changed is that Spellbook are limited to 60 points each.</p>
    <p> The arena is a 3x3 Forest Arena Gameboard which you can activate by pressing Alt+F10</p>
    <p> All normal rules are in effect, however we have limited the number of Conjurations in most of the spellbook, though we have added some in where appropriate for a given mage.</p>
    <br>
    <p> One of the most important things to learn in OCTGN is selecting a card :</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hold down the Shift Key and Click on card you wish to select.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The second is card targeting, as in targeting a creature with an attack spell:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> There are two cards involved, you will start with the first card (in this example an attack spell) by first holding down the Shift key (continue to hold the Shift key down) click the Attack card with the mouse pointer and then drag the mouse over
        to the target card, you will see an arrow appear from the Attack card to the Creature card. Now release the Shift key.</li>
      <br>
      <li> To remove either the target or arrow Shift+Click on the first card.</li>
    </ul>
